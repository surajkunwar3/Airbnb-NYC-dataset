# Reporting initial information about the dataset.
summary(FlowerPicks)
#We observe that score and time column have some NA's in them. Hence try to get rid of them in the 
#optimal way.

#Lets go for machine learning for NA removal.
library(mice)
#Distribution of the missing values.
md.pattern(FlowerPicks)

#We observe that 5475 rows have no missing values and we have 27 missing values.

#Using the mice function.
mymice <- mice(FlowerPicks,m = 5, method = "rf")

class(mymice)

#Filling the NA's with the 5th observation. After that no missing values left in observation.
mymicecomplete <- complete(mymice,5)
summary(mymicecomplete)

#Now we can start analyzing it. There are high and low scores but the time variable is different
#for each one of them.Hence the ration of score/time will give us better indication about performance

#Making a new column for analyses.

flower <- data.table(mymicecomplete)
flower <- flower[,performance := Score/Time][order(performance)]
flower

#Interpretations
head(flower,1)
tail(flower,1)

#From the above we can see that sandra performed the worst and gunner performed the best.


#Performing linear model on our dataset.

model <- lm(performance ~ Score + Time,flower)
model
summary(model)

#So from the above models we can see that both the parameters have an important significance
#on the output. Moreover for every 1% increase in score the performance increases by an average
#of 0.09% and the same decreases by nearly 5% for every 1% increase in time.
